**Physical Network Trace Project**

**Overview:**
This project involves mapping the journey data takes from a computer to a specific website. The primary objective is not only to understand the digital path but also to gain insight into the physical locations the data traverses through.

**Objective:**
By the culmination of this project, participants should be well-versed in tracing data's path to a website and have broadened their horizons with knowledge about various global locations.

**Objective Change: 09/13/23**
Due to the lack of locations in my trace route, the locations have been changed to an upcoming trip I will be going on. 

ps. if you hover over the images, the fun fact for each place shows up.
